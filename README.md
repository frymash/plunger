# Plunger ðŸª 
Inboxes can be like toilets: when there's a lot of shit inside, they can get a little difficult to unclog.

Plunger helps you get rid of the nasty stuff by making unsubscribing from mailing lists easy.

## Feature Roadmap
The following features are planned for future updates:

- [ ] Replace app passwords with Google OAuth for secure authentication.
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests (i.e. Pytest, unittest) to ensure reliability.
- [ ] Allow users to purge emails from specific mailing lists selectively.
- [ ] Introduce a GUI for better usability.
